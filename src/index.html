        <h2>Why I design</h2>
        <p>Before stepping into product design, I spent nearly a decade working in various business support roles. Looking back, I now realise I was already shaping customer experiences.<br />
          My real introduction to UI/UX design came in 2020, when I took a role as a Requirements Engineer for a car dealership app. That’s when I first noticed the Product Design team. They weren’t just documenting features, they were defining the user experience and shaping the product from the ground up.</p>
        <p>That sparked something in me. I didn’t want to just document a product, I wanted to design it. <span><span

        <h2>Designing for enterprise</h2>
        <p>I focus on <span
            class="word-highlight">enterprise web design.</span> In 2022, I joined a global leader in enterprise automation.</p>
        <p>Working in a large company came with a specific set of challenges:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Complexity in design, product and platform.</li>
          <li>Cross-team collaboration.</li>
          <li>Customer diversity & experience gaps.</li>
          <li>Decision-making and governance.</li>
          <li>Unified, scalable design system.</li>

        <p>The road ahead is about learning, refining my craft, and staying curious.<br>As I continue to grow as a product designer, 
          I’m focused on deepening my impact, building not just usable interfaces, but thoughtful, scalable solutions that genuinely improve people’s lives.<br> 
          I want to keep pushing beyond the surface, collaborating closely with users, engineers, and stakeholders to <span
