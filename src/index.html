        <h2>The spark</h2>
        <!-- <p class="subtitle">How I first became interested in design, through problem-solving and a creative passion.</p> -->
        <!-- <hr> -->
        <p>In 2020, I landed a job as a Requirements Engineer for a car dealership app.</p>
        <p>If you’re wondering how I got so “lucky” the answer is simple, my German language skills. I was
        hired to help the Romanian team communicate with the German Product Manager.</p>
        My role? Understanding and “translating” product requirements into detailed specs for the engineering team.</p>
        <p>Writing documentation all day, being a middleman, passing information back and forth, a monotonous routine.
          But amidst the monotony, something caught my attention, the product design team.</p>
        <p>While I was writing specs, they were shaping the product, defining user experiences, and driving key
          decisions.
          I watched them transform abstract ideas into intuitive designs, and for the first time, I saw the bigger
          picture.
          I realised I didn’t want to just document a product, I wanted to help create it. That’s when I knew I had to
          make a change.</p>
        <p>I started looking into product design, user experience, interaction patterns,
          and how great products are built. What began as frustration with my role turned into the spark that set me on
          this path.
          And that’s how my journey into product design began.</p>

        <!-- <p class="subtitle">The challenges I faced, and what motivated me to keep striving for a role in the field.</p> -->
        <!-- <hr> -->
        <p>Once I knew what I wanted to do, the next challenge was figuring out how to get there.
        </p>
        <p>I enrolled in a bootcamp, poured everything into learning, and convinced myself that by the end of it,
          I’d be a great (junior) hire for any company. I was wrong.
          Not about being a good candidate, but about how difficult it would be to land a job.</p>
          <p>A saturated job marked, companies prioritised experienced designers, and the rare junior roles were flooded
          with applications just like me, all fighting for the same opportunities. Standing out felt nearly
          impossible.</p>
          <p>I kept applying, refining my skills, and learning on my own. I also completed three internship
          programs,
          each shaping my perspective on design and strengthening my confidence. It was a long road, but eventually,
          I landed the job I had been working so hard for.</p>

        <h2>Designing for enterprise</h2>
        <!-- <p class="subtitle">Finding my place and how working in a large, fast-paced company has shaped my design approach.</p> -->
       <!-- <hr> -->
        <p>In the summer of 2022, I joined UiPath, a global leader in enterprise automation.</p> 
          <p>With thousands of employees and a strong presence worldwide, UiPath helps businesses reduce manual labor, enhance efficiency, and improve
          productivity by automating routine tasks across various departments.</p>
        <p>Working in such a large, fast-paced company has shaped me significantly. I became comfortable with:
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Collaborating with international teams across multiple time zones.</li>
          <li>Working alongside diverse roles, from engineers to product managers.</li>
          <li>Presenting my work regularly, participating in design critiques, and learning from other designers.</li>
          <li>Using and contributing to a mature design system, ensuring consistency while pushing for innovation.</li>
          <li>Navigating high expectations for quality, while also understanding when to make trade-offs due to
            technical constraints.</li>
          <li>Working closely with engineers to bring designs to life.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Beyond design itself, I learned to manage multiple threads at once, filtering out noise while keeping track of
        how different areas of the product connect. I became more strategic, always considering the bigger picture, how
        ongoing initiatives might impact my work and applying second-order thinking to anticipate challenges.</p>
        <p>I also learned to work with shifting priorities and varying levels of detail in requirements, adapting to change
        while maintaining clarity and focus.</p>

        <!-- <p class="subtitle">Turning challenges into intuitive solutions.</p> -->
        <!-- <hr> -->
        <p>Within the UiPath platform, my primary focus is on Orchestrator, a control center for robots,
          that enables organizations to deploy, manage, and monitor their automation at scale.</p>
          <p>The primary user persona is the central IT administrator, who's jobs to be done include:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Managing the entire automation infrastructure.</li>
          <li>Installing and configuring environments to ensure smooth automation deployment.</li>
          <li>Setting up and monitoring production environments, ensuring executions run reliably.</li>
          <li>Communicating and optimizing infrastructure requirements for efficiency and scalability.</li>
          <li>Ensuring IT landscape security and compliance with legal requirements.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We also cater to a developer persona, they will troubleshoot automations, ensuring workflows run as expected and diagnosing any issues that arise.</p>
        <p>My work revolves around improving their experience by making automation management more intuitive, efficient and seamless.</p>
