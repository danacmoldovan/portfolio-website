        <h2>The spark</h2>
        <!-- <p class="subtitle">How I first became interested in design, through problem-solving and a creative passion.</p> -->
        <!-- <hr> -->
        <p>In 2020, I landed a job as a Requirements Engineer for a car dealership app.</p>
        <p>If you’re wondering how I got so “lucky” the answer is simple, my German language skills. I was
        hired to help the Romanian team communicate with the German Product Manager.</p>
        My role? Understanding and “translating” product requirements into detailed specs for the engineering team.</p>
        <p>Writing documentation all day, being a middleman, passing information back and forth, a monotonous routine.
          But amidst the monotony, something caught my attention, the product design team.</p>
        <p>While I was writing specs, they were shaping the product, defining user experiences, and driving key
          decisions.
          I watched them transform abstract ideas into intuitive designs, and for the first time, I saw the bigger
          picture.
          I realised I didn’t want to just document a product, I wanted to help create it. That’s when I knew I had to
          make a change.</p>
        <p>I started looking into product design, user experience, interaction patterns,
          and how great products are built. What began as frustration with my role turned into the spark that set me on
          this path.
          And that’s how my journey into product design began.</p>

        <h2>The leap</h2>
        <!-- <p class="subtitle">The challenges I faced, and what motivated me to keep striving for a role in the field.</p> -->
        <!-- <hr> -->
        <p>Once I knew what I wanted to do, the next challenge was figuring out how to get there.
        </p>
        <p>I enrolled in a bootcamp, poured everything into learning, and convinced myself that by the end of it,
          I’d be a great (junior) hire for any company. I was wrong.
          Not about being a good candidate, but about how difficult it would be to land a job.</p>
          <p>A saturated job marked, companies prioritised experienced designers, and the rare junior roles were flooded
          with applications just like me, all fighting for the same opportunities. Standing out felt nearly
          impossible.</p>
          <p>I kept applying, refining my skills, and learning on my own. I also completed three internship
          programs,
          each shaping my perspective on design and strengthening my confidence. It was a long road, but eventually,
          I landed the job I had been working so hard for.</p>

        <!-- <p class="subtitle">Finding my place and how working in a large, fast-paced company has shaped my design approach.</p> -->
       <!-- <hr> -->
        <p>In the summer of 2022, I joined UiPath, a global leader in enterprise automation.</p> 
          <p>With thousands of employees and a strong presence worldwide, UiPath helps businesses reduce manual labor and improve
          productivity by automating routine tasks.</p>
        <p>Working in a large, fast-paced company has shaped me significantly:
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Collaborating across time zones with diverse teams.</li>
          <li>Partnering with engineers and PMs to bring designs to life.</li>
          <li>Presenting work regularly, icorporating feedback, and iterating.</li>
          <li>Contributing to and evolving a mature design system while pushing for innovation.</li>
          <li>Balancing high expectations of quality with technical constraints.</li>
          <li>Applying big-picture thinking to anticipate challenges.</li>
          <li>Managing complexity while maintaining clarity.</li>
          <li>Adapting to shifting priorities with focus.</li>
          <li>Embracing a culture of continuous learning and improvement.</li>

        <h2>Mastering complexity</h2>
        <!-- <p class="subtitle">Turning challenges into intuitive solutions.</p> -->
        <!-- <hr> -->
        <p>Designing for a complex B2B platform comes with significant challenges.</p> 
          <p>The product's complexity comes from all the various workflows, interdependencies, and the need to support diverse user personas 
          throughout their end-to-end journeys seamlessly.</p> 
          <p>A key challenge is balancing the needs of highly experienced, technical users who require detailed information 
            with those of less technical users who need intuitive navigation and ease of use.</p>
          <p>In addition to product complexity, there is design complexity due to multiple designers working on a wide range of features. 
            Each product within the platform has different priorities over time, which may be addressed separately or in different ways 
            but must ultimately align for a cohesive experience.</p>
          
          <p>To address these challenges, I focus on clear communication, 
            regular design reviews, and alignment syncs to ensure consistency and collaboration across teams.</p>
