        <h2>The spark</h2>
        <p>In 2020, I landed a job as a Requirements Engineer for a car dealership app.<br/> 
        But something caught my attention, the product design team. They were shaping the product, defining user experiences and driving key decisions.</p>
        <p>I realised I also wanted to create intuitive products, not just document them.</p>

        <h2>The leap</h2>
        <p>Once I knew what I wanted to do, the next challenge was figuring out how to get there.</p>
        <p>I poured effort into learning, shaping my perspective on design and strengthening my confidence. Completed a bootcamp and a couple of internships, before landing my first job as a product designer.</p>

        <h2>Designing for enterprise</h2>
        <p>In 2022, I joined a global leader in enterprise automation. I focus on <span class="word-highlight">enterprise web design.</span></p> 
        <p>What working in a large company taught me:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Collaborating across time zones with diverse teams.</li>
          <li>Partnering with engineers and PMs to bring designs to life.</li>
          <li>Presenting work regularly, icorporating feedback, and iterating.</li>
          <li>Contributing to an evolving design system while pushing for innovation.</li>
          <li>Balancing high expectations of quality with technical constraints.</li>
          <li>Applying big-picture thinking to anticipate challenges.</li>
          <li>Managing complexity while maintaining clarity.</li>
          <li>Adapting to shifting priorities with focus.</li>
          <li>Embracing a culture of continuous learning and improvement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Mastering complexity</h2>
        <p>Designing for a complex B2B platform comes with it's challenges.</p> 
          <p><span class="word-highlight">Platform complexity</span> through incorporating different products, various workflows, interdependencies, and the need to support diverse user personas 
          in their end-to-end journeys.</p> 
          <p>It has been challenging to balance the needs of highly experienced, technical users who expect access to detailed information about their systems 
            with those of less technical users who need intuitive navigation and guidance.</p>
          <p><span class="word-highlight">Design complexity</span> also arises. Multiple designers working on a wide range of features, 
            each product within the platform with a different set of priorities that must ultimately align for a cohesive experience.</p>
          <p>To address these challenges, I focus on clear communication. I'm not afraid to ask questions, share my work and ask for 
            alignment syncs to ensure consistency and collaboration across teams.</p>
