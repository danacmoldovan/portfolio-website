        <h2>The spark</h2>
        <!-- <p class="subtitle">How I first became interested in design, through problem-solving and a creative passion.</p> -->
        <!-- <hr> -->
        <p>In 2020, I became a Requirements Engineer for a car dealership app.</p>
        <p>While "translating" product requirements into detailed specs for the engineering team something caught my attention, the product design team.</p>
        <p>They were shaping the product, defining user experiences, and driving key decisions. 
          I watched them transform abstract ideas into intuitive designs, and for the first time, I saw the bigger
          picture. I realised I didn’t want to just document a product, I wanted to help create it.</p>
        <p>I started looking into product design, user experience, interaction patterns, and how great products are built. 
          What began as frustration with my role turned into the spark that set me on this path.</p>

        <h2>The leap</h2>
        <!-- <p class="subtitle">The challenges I faced, and what motivated me to keep striving for a role in the field.</p> -->
        <!-- <hr> -->
        <p>Once I knew what I wanted to do, the next challenge was figuring out how to get there.
        </p>
        <p>I enrolled in a bootcamp, poured everything into learning, and convinced myself that by the end of it,
          I’d be a great (junior) hire for any company. I was wrong.
          Not about being a good candidate, but about how difficult it would be to land a job.</p>
          <p>A saturated job marked, companies prioritised experienced designers, and the rare junior roles were flooded
          with applications just like me, all fighting for the same opportunities. Standing out felt nearly
          impossible.</p>
          <p>I kept applying, refining my skills, and learning on my own. I also completed three internship
          programs,
          each shaping my perspective on design and strengthening my confidence. It was a long road, but eventually,
          I landed the job I had been working so hard for.</p>

        <h2>Designing for enterprise</h2>
        <!-- <p class="subtitle">Finding my place and how working in a large, fast-paced company has shaped my design approach.</p> -->
       <!-- <hr> -->
        <p>In the summer of 2022, I joined a global leader in enterprise automation. <span class="word-highlight"> Web design</span> is my core focus.</p> 
        <p>Being part of a company that has thousands of employees and a strong presence worldwide has shaped me significantly:
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Collaborating across time zones with diverse teams.</li>
          <li>Partnering with engineers and PMs to bring designs to life.</li>
          <li>Presenting work regularly, icorporating feedback, and iterating.</li>
          <li>Contributing to an evolving design system while pushing for innovation.</li>
          <li>Balancing high expectations of quality with technical constraints.</li>
          <li>Applying big-picture thinking to anticipate challenges.</li>
          <li>Managing complexity while maintaining clarity.</li>
          <li>Adapting to shifting priorities with focus.</li>
          <li>Embracing a culture of continuous learning and improvement.</li>

        <h2>Mastering complexity</h2>
        <!-- <p class="subtitle">Turning challenges into intuitive solutions.</p> -->
        <!-- <hr> -->
        <p>Designing for a complex B2B platform comes with it's challenges.</p> 
          <p><span class="word-highlight">Platform complexity</span> through incorporating different products, various workflows, interdependencies, and the need to support diverse user personas 
          in their end-to-end journeys.</p> 
          <p>It has been challenging to balance the needs of highly experienced, technical users who expect access to detailed information about their systems 
            with those of less technical users who need intuitive navigation and guidance.</p>
          <p><span class="word-highlight">Design complexity</span> also arises. Multiple designers working on a wide range of features, 
            each product within the platform with a different set of priorities that must ultimately align for a cohesive experience.</p>
          <p>To address these challenges, I focus on clear communication. I'm not afraid to ask questions, share my work and ask for 
            alignment syncs to ensure consistency and collaboration across teams.</p>
