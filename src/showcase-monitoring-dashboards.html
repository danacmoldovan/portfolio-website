        <p>Challenge: Consolidating key data into a single, readable interface that enables users to track, interpret
          and act on trends quickly.</p>
        <p>User problems:
          <li class="list">I can't tell which metrics need my attention without digging through multiple views.</li>
          <li class="list">The dashboard is cluttered, making it hard to find what I need quickly.</li>
          <li class="list">I don't get timely alerts when something goes wrong or deviates from normal behavior.</li>
        <p>
        <p>Business problems:
          <li class="list">Missed incidents or performance issues due to ineffective alerting lead to service outages
            or
            customer dissatisfaction.</li>
          <li class="list">Poor dashboard usability reduces adoption and return on data investments.</li>
          <li class="list">Teams waste time making sense of fragmented reports, delaying decisions.</li>
